# CoFrA Metamodel
Nowadays, there are many mechanisms to perform
authentication, such as text passwords and biometrics. How-
ever, reasoning about their relevance (e.g., the appropriateness
for security and usability) regarding the contextual situation
is challenging for an authentication system designers. We present a Context-driven Modelling Framework for
dynamic Authentication decisions (COFRA) where the relevance
of authentication mechanisms is specified according to context
information. COFRA is based on a precise metamodel that reveals
framework abstractions and a set of constraints that specify their
meaning. Therefore, it provides a concrete language to determine
the relevant authentication mechanisms (characterized by a set of
properties that ensure their appropriateness) in a given context.
Authentication system designers can benefit from COFRA to get
recommendations on how to use contextual information for au-
thentication at design time.  

# Evaluating and Comparinng Model Instances: A Tool Supported Approach for the Selection of Tailored Adaptive Authentication Models
There are many authentication models conform to CoFrA. However, which context information to use and how to adapt is currently not disclosed. In addition, when adaptation models for adaptive authentication (AA) are chosen and designed, engineers often fail to evaluate them. Thus, there is a need for evaluating and benchmarking these models, which is not a trivial process. Indeed, multiple quality criteria must be considered, such as usability, security, privacy, deployability. Moreover, the criteria sometimes conflict with each other and change over time, which complexifies further the evaluation of AA. We propose an extensible tooled approach for evaluating the quality of AA models according to multiple criteria. This evaluation allows authentication engineers to choose the correct model for their authentication system. Furthermore, they can use our approach to test and refine different models during the whole life-cycle of the authentication system (e.g., changing the contextual features, adding new authentication methods).
